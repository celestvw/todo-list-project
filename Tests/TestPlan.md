# Test Plan - Application: To do List #
## Test Approach ##
#### In this test plan we discuss the overall approach of the project. ####
- Agile methodology - 2 week sprints
- BDD (behaviour driven development) Given, When, Then
- The test approach will focus on the front end of the apllication
- Manual test execution
- Cordova - must run as a mobile application
- Target audience - who will use this application
- Defect tracking with JIRA

## Objective ##
- The objective of this project is to enusre the delivery of the To Do List application as working software. This application must run as a web and mobile application.

### In Scope: ##
##### The following functionalites must be implemented for this application based on the requirement spesifications: ####
1. Application must be deployed in Docker
2. Application must be ported to Cordova to run as a mobile application
3. Adding of items to the To Do list application
4. Editing existing information 
5. Deleting existing or new items added on the To Do List application
6. Application must be hosted so that multiple users can view it
7. Application's back end must be managed on Kubernetes to ensure self healing, should any services break and scalability for future feature implementations. 

### Out of Scope: ###
- Penetration Testing
- Functionality - Date at which items must be completed
- UI - cosmetic enhancements

### Testing Types: ###
 - Unit, Functional, API, Regression, Load, Usability and Sanity testing

 ### Environments: ###
  - Development, Acceptance/Staging, Hosting, Production

### Tools: ###
- Hardware - PC, Mobile Device, OS - Android
- Software - JIRA, Github, Docker, Kubernetes, Cordova, Cucumber js

### Responsibilities: ###
1. Product Owner: Create all user stories for the project, define the acceptance criteria 
2. Developer: Code the application to the technical spesification, deployments to acceptance, fixing any defects found
3. QA Analyst: Create test scenarios and test cases to meet the application requirements, manual test execution and log defects
4. Team: Define the definition of done for this project

### Estimates: ###
- Development - 2 days (16 hours)
- Test execution - 1 day (8 hours)

### Risks: ###
- Application hosted on a cloud server - The risk is not having a SSL certificate in place is a security vulnerability.
- Mitigate Risk - Ensure a SSL certificate is in place on the hosted service before hosting the application on the site.

### Test data requirements: ###
- All test data must be gathered from the existing database of actions availabe:
1. Add
2. Edit
3. Delete

### Exit Criteria: ###
- The exit criteria for this application is when all functional requirements are met, all defects are resolved and the QA Analyst has signed off the tested software. The application is presented to the Product Owner and Stakeholders and business provides sign off for the project to be deployed to production, therefore providing a working application that can be consumed by the public.
